- buildbot Nightly scheduler that can pick a uniform revision server side and with support
  for specifying possibly branches

- improve summary page (defined in pypybuildbot/summary.page),  support querying/slicing
  by builders, formatting and css

- some kind of progress information for a run

- support for better information in case of runner-level killed hanging tests

- pypy-c py.test -A support

- look into why the full summary page but not single rev is slowish

- have a way for the involved tool to avoid color escapes even when there's a tty (because of buildbot pty usage)
