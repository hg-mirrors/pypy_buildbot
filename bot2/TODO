- runner for running tests per directory and optionally in parallel
  (this should be inspired by the current autotest.py running strategy minus the htmlconftest
   details) [IN-PROGRESS]

- buildbot Nightly scheduler that can pick a uniform revision server side and with support
  for specifying possibly branches

- improve summary page (defined in pypybuildbot/summary.page),  support querying/slicing
  by builders/revisions(/branches), formatting and css

- build/support for running cpython on tests, adaptations to produce structured logs and be compatible
  with the py.lib trunk are probably necessary for lib-python/conftest.py

- pypy-c py.test -A support

- fix pypy conftests not to use deprecated interfaces
