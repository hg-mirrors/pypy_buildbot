- buildbot Nightly scheduler that can pick a uniform revision server side and with support
  for specifying possibly branches

- improve summary page (defined in pypybuildbot/summary.page),  support querying/slicing
  by builders, formatting and css

- some kind of progress information for a run

- support for better information in case of runner-level killed hanging tests

- pypy-c py.test -A support

- have a way for the involved tool to avoid color escapes even when there's a tty (because of buildbot pty usage)

- move most buildbots to be over python 2.5 (?)

- wire windows slave IN-PROGRESS

- convention for naming and coalescing alternative builders for the same build

- implement pre-switch logic to avoid the full checkouts when running non default branches

- timeout issues with the run of our own rests, probably increase timeout and/or explode other dirs
  but also adding better debugging info, right now that the problem is there is not evident
