- buildbot Nightly scheduler that can pick a uniform revision server side and with support
  for specifying possibly branches

- some kind of progress information for a run

- support for better information in case of runner-level killed hanging tests

- pypy-c py.test -A support IN-PROGRESS

- have a way for the involved tool to avoid color escapes even when there's a tty (because of buildbot pty usage)

- move most buildbots to be over python 2.5 (?)

- wire windows slave IN-PROGRESS

- slave for own test need pexect (seems not to be there on wyvern's python?)

- convention for naming and coalescing alternative builders for the same build

- implement pre-switch logic to avoid the full checkouts when running non default branches

- it seems there is no timeout detection anymore for the lib-python tests (?)
