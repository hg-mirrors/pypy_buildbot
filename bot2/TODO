Issues (in descending priority order)
----------------------------------------
- it seems there is no timeout detection anymore for the lib-python tests (?) !

- (fijal) There is a bunch of exceptions that should be reported as skipped on view.

  TestSkipped, ResourceDenied comes to mind. Not sure what else

- slave for own test need pexect (seems not to be there on wyvern's python?)

- move most buildbots to be over python 2.5 or 2.6 (LIKELY)

- buildbot Nightly scheduler that can pick a uniform revision server side and with support
  for specifying possibly branches

- convention for naming and coalescing alternative builders for the same build


Nice to have
---------------

- implement pre-switch logic to avoid the full checkouts when running non default branches

- some kind of progress information for a run

- have a way for the involved tool to avoid color escapes even when there's a tty (because of buildbot pty usage)
